# solution. List the computing ids of all of your collaborators in the
# comments at the top of each submitted file. Do not share written notes,
# documents (including Google docs, Overleaf docs, discussion notes, PDFs), or
# code. Do not seek published or online solutions, including pseudocode, for
# this assignment. If you use any published or online resources (which may not
# include solutions) when completing this assignment, be sure to cite them. Do
# not submit a solution that you are unable to explain orally to a member of
# the course staff. Any solutions that share similar text/code will be
# considered in breach of this policy. Please refer to the syllabus for a
